# jMath Library
A simple math library that I developed from 2000 to 2002 and used in several game and graphics projects.

**Features**
This library contains a collection of building blocks that are found in most larger math libraries, including:

- **Linear algebra**: vector2, vector3, vector4, matrix2, matrix3, matrix4, quaternion, point, plane
- **Non-linear algebra**: curves, surfaces, paths
- **Geometry**: frustum, camera, spheres, bounds, aabb, rbb, bsp-tree, kd-tree, quad-tree, oct-tree
- **Numeric**: random, hash, alignment, fast log, inv sqrt, principal component analysis
- **Intersect**: collision detection, ray casting
- **Statistics**: estimate, regressions, linear least squares, mean, deviation, variance, covariance
